## Scripts for multi-state analysis:
##
## clean_state_hist.R: Script for cleaning possibly overlapping multi-state histories, see the script for more details.
## mydata.Rdata: Simulated toy dataset to use with clean_state_hist.R
## mstateAalen.R: functions for additive hazards multi-state models
##
## Note: all functions are made for personal use give no warnings or errors when used incorrectly.
## More robust code may come at a later time
